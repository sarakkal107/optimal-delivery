# OptimalDelivery

This software is a route planning system and the purpose of this product is to provide the user with the most optimal and cost efficient route to the trucks between the pick-up point which is predetermined and the consumer. This project utilized the following libraries: mlrose-hiive, PyInputPlus, bcrypt, Passlib, and Pytest.


## Basic Setup
1. [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). Don't forget to add the poetry command to your PATH (Instructions to do this is given post-installation)
2. Navigate to the GitHub Project
3. Install Dependencies with `poetry install`
4. Run with `poetry run python3 rutgersdelivery/main.py`. You need Python 3.9 and above to run

## How to run test cases

We ran the testcases using pytest. 
1. Navigate to the 'tests' section of the code
2. Embedded in this section you need to go to the 'test_rutgersdelivery.py' file
3. In order to check that our unit testing works, navigate to the command line and type 'poetry run pytest'
4. If the program outputs 'All tests passed' then the testing is successful.
